So after about 10 projects of building simple things and combining YouTube
tutorials together I wanted to challenge myself.

I found this YouTube tutorial for a search bar animation and decided to see if
I could create it without using the tutorial. It would be the first "real" thing
I build myself. When I finish I can watch the tutorial and reflect on any
differences in implementation.

Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1PeTDrw6OY.

It took me 30 minutes to get the core functionality working and another 18
minutes to get the animation to have the look I wanted.

==================

My implementation ...

Put a text input and button inside of a div. Make the text input fill the div.
Make the button a circle slightly shorter than the div and anchor its position
relative to the right edge. Manage the animation by changing the div width via
hover/unhover.
