A simple challenge to a beginner: make a stopwatch where the user can start,
stop, pause, and reset. It isn't clear to me what the difference is between
stop and pause are. Perhaps stop means pause and reset simultaneously? I'm going
to adjust the parameters of the challenge and model my stopwatch after the
stopwatch on my mobile.

Lucky for me I have a coding background so I think I can plan ahead for how I
want to design this app.

The core piece of user feedback is the time on the stopwatch which I intend to
display hours:minutes:seconds. This will loop over at 99:59:59.

The core features are start, stop, resume, and reset. The initial state of the
stopwatch is 00:00:00 on the clock and a start button. The clock increments
upon pressing the start button and the start button changes to a stop button.
Upon pressing the stop button, the clock pauses and the stop button changes to
a resume button and a reset button. The resume button brings the app back to a
clock increment state while the reset button brings the app back to the start
state. This closes the loop of the application.

I'll layout the functional components on one commit and then iteratively
commit changes for the app's look.
